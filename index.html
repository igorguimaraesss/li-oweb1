        Lighthouse can be run as a Chrome Extension, from the command line, or used programmatically as a Node 
        module. You give Lighthouse a URL that you audit, it runs a barrage of tests against the page,
        and then it generates a report on how well the page did. From here you can use the failing tests as 
          <strike> indicators on what you can do</strike> 
        to improve your app.</p>



      <h2>Setting up Lighthouse</h2>

      The Lighthouse Viewer is a useful way for viewing and sharing reports, online.

        The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial
        intelligence due to its enormous search space and the difficulty of evaluating
         board positions and moves.

    </p>

    <p>The Viewer also lets you share reports with others. Reports can be shared by clicking the share icon in the top right corner and signing in to Github. Reports are stashed as secret gists in your account so you can easily delete or update the report later on. Using Github for data storage also means free version control.</p>
